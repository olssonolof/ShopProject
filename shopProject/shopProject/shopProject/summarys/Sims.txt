The Sims is a strategic life-simulation video game developed by Maxis and published by Electronic Arts in 2000. It is a simulation of the daily activities of one or more virtual people ("Sims") in a suburban household near a fictional city. The game's development was led by Will Wright and the game was a follow-up to Wright's earlier SimCity series. The Sims original series had a total of seven expansion packs produced from 2000 to 2003, with expansions adding new items, characters, skins, and features. The game has had several subsequent sequels; The Sims 2 in 2004, The Sims 3 in 2009, and The Sims 4 in 2014.
